    <p>Operating systems are an essential part of any computer system. Similarly,
            a course on operating systems is an essential part of any computer science
            education. This field is undergoing rapid change, as computers are now
            prevalent in virtually every arena of day-to-day lifeâ€” from embedded devices
            in automobiles through the most sophisticated planning tools for governments
            and multinational firms. Yet the fundamental concepts remain fairly clear, and
            it is on these that we base this book.
            We wrote this book as a text for an introductory course in operating systems
            at the junior or senior undergraduate level or at the first-year graduate level. We
            hope that practitioners will also find it useful. It provides a clear description of
            the concepts that underlie operating systems. As prerequisites, we assume that
            the reader is familiar with basic data structures, computer organization, and
            a high-level language, such as C or Java. The hardware topics required for an
            understanding of operating systems are covered in Chapter 1. In that chapter,
            we also include an overview of the fundamental data structures that are
            prevalent in most operating systems. For code examples, we use predominantly
            C, with some Java, but the reader can still understand the algorithms without
            a thorough knowledge of these languages</p>

    <p>Concepts are presented using intuitive descriptions. Important theoretical
            results are covered, but formal proofs are largely omitted. The bibliographical
            notes at the end of each chapter contain pointers to research papers in which
            results were first presented and proved, as well as references to recent material
            for further reading. In place of proofs, figures and examples are used to suggest
            why we should expect the result in question to be true.
            The fundamental concepts and algorithms covered in the book are often
            based on those used in both commercial and open-source operating systems.
            Our aim is to present these concepts and algorithms in a general setting that
            is not tied to one particular operating system. However, we present a large
            number of examples that pertain to the most popular and the most innovative
            operating systems, including Linux, Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and
            Solaris. We also include examples of both Android and iOS, currently the two
            dominant mobile operating systems.
            The organization of the text reflects our many years of teaching courses on
            operating systems, as well as curriculum guidelines published by the IEEE
            </p>

    <p>Overview. Chapters 1 and 2 explain what operating systems are, what
            they do, and how they are designed and constructed. These chapters
            discuss what the common features of an operating system are and what an
            operating system does for the user. We include coverage of both traditional
            PC and server operating systems, as well as operating systems for mobile
            devices. The presentation is motivational and explanatory in nature. We
            have avoided a discussion of how things are done internally in these
            chapters. Therefore, they are suitable for individual readers or for students
            in lower-level classes who want to learn what an operating</p>
